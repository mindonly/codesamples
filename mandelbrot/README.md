# Mandelbrot

Draws the Mandelbrot set, the boundary of which is a famous fractal. The general approach is to map the complex plane to pixels on the screen, creating an image. The Mandelbrot set is defined by the iterated quadratic map *z^2 + c*, where *z* and *c* are complex numbers.

The included animated gifs show the results.
