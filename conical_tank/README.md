# Conical Tank

Using Toricelli's Law, model the emptying of a cone-shaped tank with an opening at the bottom. The tank has a radius of 8 feet and is 8 feet tall. The hole at the bottom has a radius of 0.1 feet and the tank starts completely full (water height = 8 feet).

After 60 minutes, the water height is 7.87 feet. After 120 minutes, the water height is 7.46 feet. The tank completely empties during minute 1507.

This problem was modeled using Julia's DifferentialEquations.jl library.
